    // For anyone poking around in this code, BleakCodex is the genius behind this! I only edited numbers to get things (mostly) looking right. If you want to use Sprites in Detail, and don't *specifically* need this version, download BleakCodex's version instead!

    // As for compatibility, I'll guess that this version is *not* compatible with the OG version, and any mods using it, will likely not work properly with both installed at once.
